1)  Simple vector data, stored in 2D tensors of shape (samples,
features), is often processed by densely connected layers, also called fully connected or dense
layers (the Dense class in Keras). Sequence data, stored in 3D tensors of shape (samples,
timesteps, features), is typically processed by recurrent layers such as an LSTM layer.
Image data, stored in 4D tensors, is usually processed by 2D convolution layers (Conv2D).
2)  Use binary crossentropy for a two-class classification
problem, categorical crossentropy for a many-class classification problem, meansquared error for a regression problem, connectionist temporal classification (CTC)
for a sequence-learning problem, and so on.
